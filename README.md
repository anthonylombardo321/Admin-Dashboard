## Features
* Side Navigation Bar
* Grid Layout
* Projects Section with icons that lead to the project's site and repository.
* To-Do List With Custom Checkboxes
* Resources Section

## What I Learned:
* How to combine Grid and Flex to create a responsive layout.
* A better understanding of Grid (Especially when to use auto when creating rows and columns). 
* Also, how to place HTML elements inside a grid layout (Still need more practice with this).
* How to change an image's color by using filter.
* How to create a custom checkbox.
